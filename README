Run the simulator with one of the following: 

./tmsim -add [x] [y]
./tmsim -mult [x] [y]
./tmsim -exp [x] [y]

It will generate a trace file in the current directory. 
Some notes about the traces:

1) Traces for addition have maximum detail. They are given for each individual
   computation step.

2) All states are labelled with names that describe what they are intended to do
   from the time the TM transitions to them, until the time when the TM 
   transitions to another state. 

3) Some state labels have asterisks (*) because these labels actually represent
   a set of states and a number of computation steps that transition between
   them.

4) In mult and exp, moving from the last cell with a 0 or 1 on the tape to the 
   first cell that has a 0 1 is done by condensing 3 states into one to reduce
   the trace length.

5) In mult, additions on the second tape are done sequentially without 
   interruption in an identical matter to the simulated addition machine.
   The only difference, of course, is that there is no halt state, but instead
   a transition to a predetermined next state in the multiplication TM.
   Add* represents the states traversed during the entire addition before this 
   final transition to save space in the trace.

6) Similarly, in exp, mult is treated as though it's a single state that only
   transitions to another state during a step of computation when the 
   multiplication has finished and the output is on the second tape.

7) Generally, mult and exp also reduce trace length by only providing 
   information about the configuration at "critical steps" where a transition
   between a state and some other state (not back to itself) occurs.
